## Version 1.2

Release date: February 16, 2019

Largely a stability and performance improvement release, this version focused on enabling asynchronous execution of methods and better performance for high-frequency actions.  We also introduced a system that allows users to see the transaction costs accrued by their clients, and allows admins to set the relative cost in transactions for each service.  Numerous bug fixes were also included.

* GIS-354: Implemented transaction system, including:
        *Ability to record and report on the cost of API actions separately from simple request volume.
        * Ability for admins to set a relative transaction cost multiplier on a per-service basis.
        * User-facing UI for visualizing transaction accrual over the past rolling 24-hour period (timeframe to be expanded in the future).
* GIS-358: Improved the performance of looking up a client by API key.
* GIS-374: Implemented async/await pattern with CancellationToken support across the API surface for better scalability and responsiveness in certain scenarios.
* GIS-419: Finalized the rename of ThinkGeo.GisServer to ThinkGeo.Cloud throughout the solution.
* GIS-423: Bug fixes related to the ThinkGeo Cloud Maps Vector Tiles and ThinkGeo Cloud Maps Raster Tiles services:
        *Fixed NullReferenceException when a negative X or Y coordinate is requested from the MapsRasterController.
        * Fixed NullReferenceException when a negative Z value is requested from the MapsVectorController.
        * Added missing range validation for the Z value in the MapsVectorController.
* GIS-424: Added creation time to account entities.
* GIS-429: Fixed bug where the required STYLES parameter was not validated on requests to either the legacy or current-gen WMS endpoints.
* GIS-430: Bug fixes related to the ThinkGeo Cloud Maps WMS service:
        * Support rendering non-square WMS images.
        *Added maximum WMS image width and height setting with corresponding validation.  Exposed this value in the GetCapabilities response.
        * Improved drawing strategy for ThinkGeo logo watermark on anonymous requests.
* GIS-431: Obfuscated certain request parameters when saving log messages.
* GIS-433: Improved accuracy of some documentation in the API explorer page.

        *Added auto-incrementing Revision and Build numbers to all projects (e.g. 1.1.6948.25477 is the full version number of todayâ€™s release).  The Revision number is the number of days since 1/1/2000 and the Build number is the number of seconds since midnight, divided by two, of the time the solution was built.
        * Display ThinkGeo.Cloud version number on the Server Settings page in the web console so we can tell what build version the environment is running.
